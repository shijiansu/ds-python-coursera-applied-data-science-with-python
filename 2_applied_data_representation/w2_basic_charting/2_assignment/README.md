Describe how your visual leverages the guidelines of effective visual design outlined in module one of this course.
The qualities of a great visualization is that it is truthful, has functionality, has beauty, is insightful,
and is enlightening. Below are the leverages.

1. truthfulness:
1) Including all data except the leap date as required.

2. functionality:
1) To avoid the misunderstanding of the label at the X axis and confusing the values of month and day,
I use the abbreviation for the month instead of the number to display the temperature month.
2) Adjusted the ymin, ymax of the Y axis, dynamically get the highest and lowest temperature degree value
from the dataset, and make them -10/+10 to be the final value of ymin, ymax in Y axis. It can make the data
be more confortable and clear to read.
3) As the diagram has 2 subsets of the data, which are year 2005-2014 and year 2015,
so I put the year information at the title and legend, to tell the audiences about the year information.

3. beauty:
1) To make sure the audiences easier to read the dot of year 2015 data, I make the dot on the top of the layers,
so that it would not be overlapped by the lines of the record high or record low.
2) Removing unnecessary borders to make the diagram clearer.

4. insightful:
1) Using the light colors (yellow and green) for the lines of the record high or record low,
and stronger colors (red and blue) for the broken high and low, so that the audiences are easier to
notice the dots if any.
