1. Identify the specific component(s) of the visual that is/are misleading
Answer: 
There are 3 misleading components,
1) There are different colors of the lines connecting the years. From year 2008 to year 2012, it is the light blue. From the year 2012 to year 2017, it is the dark blue.
2) The lines connecting the years are the curves. 
3) There is a orange line marked with label of "TREND", which is starting at the year 2014, and crossing the year 2017, then finally ending to the position of the year 2013.

2. For each part(s) of the visualization that is/are misleading, identify the mechanism that is used: 
1) Hiding relevant data to highlight what benefits us; 
2) Displaying too much data to obscure reality; 
3) Using graphic forms in inappropriate ways (distorting the data)
Answer: 
It is the misleading of "Using graphic forms in inappropriate ways (distorting the data)".

3. Explain how the mechanisms are used to mislead
Answer: 
1) About the light / dark blue colors. There are not indications or explanation about why the colors are different. I am not sure if the dark blue color suggests the sign or clue for the economy trend or for the GDP growth pattern.
2) I don't know what the curves is suggesting. Especially from the year 2012 to year 2013, and from the year 2013 to year 2014. The curvatures are large and one goes up first and later goes down (year 2012 to 2013), but another goes down first and later goes up (year 2013 to 2014) 
3) The line marked with label of "TREND" looks as starting at the year 2014, and ending at the year 2013. It suggests the trend going up, but actually the data of "Annual GDP growth, % change on a year earlier" fluctuates up and down
