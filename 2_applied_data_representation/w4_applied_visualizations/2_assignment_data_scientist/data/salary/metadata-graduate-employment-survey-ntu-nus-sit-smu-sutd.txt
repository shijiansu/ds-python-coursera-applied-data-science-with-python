    (from 2014) and SUTD (from 2015) annually to survey the employment conditions
    of graduates about six months after their final examinations.  The Ministry of
    Education (MOE) publishes the results of key employment indicators of the survey
    to provide prospective students with timely and comparable data to assist them
    in making informed course decisions.  Graduates from NTU, NUS and SMU were surveyed
    in Nov.  Due to their different academic calendars, graduates from SUTD and SIT
    were surveyed in Feb and Mar.'
