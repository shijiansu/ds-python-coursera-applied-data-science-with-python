## Introduction to Data Science in Python

About this course: This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, 
including how to download and install python, expected fundamental python programming techniques, 
and how to find help with python programming questions. The course will also introduce data manipulation and 
cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of 
he DataFrame as the central data structure for data analysis. The course will end with a statistics primer, 
showing how various statistical measures can be applied to pandas DataFrames. By the end of the course, 
students will be able to take tabular data, clean it,  manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.

This course is number 1 in the Applied Data Science with Python specialization and should be taken before 
any other courses in the specialization.

Who is this class for: This course is part of the skills-based specialization "Applied Data Science with Python"
and is intended for learners who have basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistics,
machine learning, information visualization, social network analysis, and text analysis techniques to gain new insight
into data. Only minimal statistics background is expected, and the first course contains a refresh of
these basic concepts. There are no geographic restrictions. Learners with a formal training in Computer Science
but without formal training in data science will still find the skills they acquire in these courses valuable
in their studies and careers.

## Syllabus
#### WEEK 1

In this week you'll get an introduction to the field of data science, review common Python functionality and
features which data scientists use, and be introduced to the Coursera Jupyter Notebook for the lectures.
All of the course information on grading, prerequisites, and expectations are on the course syllabus,
and you can find more information about the Jupyter Notebooks on our Course Resources page.

#### WEEK 2
In this week of the course you'll learn the fundamentals of one of the most important toolkits Python has for
data cleaning and processing -- pandas. You'll learn how to read in data into DataFrame structures,
how to query these structures, and the details about such structures are indexed. The module ends with
a programming assignment and a discussion question.

#### WEEK 3
In this week you'll deepen your understanding of the python pandas library by learning how to merge DataFrames,
generate summary tables, group data into logical pieces, and manipulate dates. We'll also refresh your
understanding of scales of data, and discuss issues with creating metrics for analysis. The week ends
with a more significant programming assignment.

#### WEEK 4
In this week of the course you'll be introduced to a variety of statistical techniques such a distributions,
sampling and t-tests. The majority of the week will be dedicated to your course project, where you'll engage
in a real-world data cleaning activity and provide evidence for (or against!) a given hypothesis.
This project is suitable for a data science portfolio, and will test your knowledge of cleaning, merging,
manipulating, and test for significance in data. The week ends with two discussions of science and
the rise of the fourth paradigm -- data driven discovery.
